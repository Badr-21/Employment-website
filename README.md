# Employment website
Employment website is my second portfolio project, it's a job search website using data extracted from [The muse api](https://www.themuse.com/developers/api/v2) and stored in a JSON file.

## Usage
It's very simple, you need to write a job title or a keyword in the input field (What) or the location in the input field (where), or write both, then click on search.

You can also search for remote job in the input field (where).

You can click on the job to show more details.
